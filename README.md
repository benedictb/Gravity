# Gravity
---
Gravity is an X11 particle sandbox written in C for my final project in Fundamentals of Computing I. After compiling, execute the ```Gravity``` binary and controls will be printed on the screen. Gravity uses the gfx libraries written by R. Bualuan with his permission, which are included in the src folder, along with the program code. 

To compile, simply ```make``` in the repository root directory.

## Controls:
* Left lick to reset
* Right click for a bigger reset  
* Type **s** for a different dot syle
* Type **r** for a different color scheme 
* Type **a** to increase acceleration 
* Type **z** to decrease acceleration
* Type "**.**" to pause
* Type **q** to quit

Additionally, there are four different patterns that the program can simulate
* Type **e** for a flow pattern 
* Type **f** for a fade pattern 
* Type **g** for a gravity pattern
* Type **p** for a pulse pattern
